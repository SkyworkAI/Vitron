I2VGen-XL is capable of generating high-quality, realistically animated, and temporally coherent high-definition videos from a single input static image, based on user input.


*Our initial version has already been open-sourced on [Modelscope](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/Image-to-Video/summary). This project focuses on improving the version, especially in terms of motions and semantics.*
